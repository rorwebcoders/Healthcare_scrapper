",stermd01@nyu.edu,,,"I chose to specialize in interventional pulmonology because it offers the opportunity to perform hands-on procedures that directly help patients, and it involves innovative research into new treatments for lung disease. Interventional pulmonology began to emerge as a medical specialty as I was finishing medical school, so I had the chance to work with pioneers who built the specialty into what it is today—a hybrid of pulmonary medicine and thoracic surgery, in which we perform minimally invasive procedures to diagnose and treat people with cancers of the chest.

I evaluate patients at NYU Langone Pulmonary and Critical Care Associates and Perlmutter Cancer Center, diagnosing and treating people who have lung cancer, malignant pleura mesothelioma—a rare cancer affecting the membranes lining the lungs—and pleural effusion, which is a buildup of fluid between those membranes. I diagnose and manage cancers and benign disorders affecting the large airways of the lungs: the trachea and bronchi. I also perform staging procedures to determine the degree of advancement of a person’s condition.
When someone first comes to my office, we sit down and have an in-depth discussion about his or her medical history. I talk to family members and friends to obtain detailed background information about my patient’s experiences. When I have this information, I use a physical exam, imaging tests, and discussions with other NYU Langone specialists to create a specific diagnostic, staging, or treatment plan.
This holistic and patient-centered approach to care is the foundation of all care at Perlmutter Cancer Center and NYU Langone Pulmonary and Critical Care Associates. When patients come to see me at Perlmutter Cancer Center, they can also visit with chemotherapy and radiation experts—thoracic medical oncologists and thoracic radiation oncologists, respectively—as well as thoracic surgeons, all in the same afternoon. We aim to make the visit as positive as possible, the procedures as safe as possible, and the treatments as easy as possible for every patient. 
We are also building on a long and historic track record of advancements in pulmonary and critical care medicine here at NYU Langone. In addition to offering a variety of chest services across the hospital, we participate in novel research and clinical trials. I have spent the last 18 years studying ways to use gene therapy and immunotherapy to control tumors of the chest, treat people with both lung cancer and malignant pleural mesothelioma, and improve and prolong the quality of patients’ lives.","Interests

Research Summary
Dr. Sterman’s research interests are related to the treatment of thoracic malignancies, specifically as they apply to the synergy of molecular medicine and novel technologies in Interventional Pulmonology.  Over the past 17 years, he has focused on the translation of laboratory discoveries from the bench to the bedside: conducting Phase I human clinical trials of gene therapy and vaccine therapy for lung cancer, mesothelioma, and other pleural malignancies. Dr. Sterman is the lead clinical investigator in the multidisciplinary Thoracic Oncology Research Group at Penn and has been the Principal Investigator of Project 1 (Clinical Trials Project) for this NCI Program Project Grant since 1998. He is currently the sponsor and Principal Investigator of the ongoing Ad.IFN gene therapy trial aimed at patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma. Dr. Sterman and colleagues are developing trials involving delivery of the interferon-alpha gene via adenoviral vector in combination with standard chemotherapy, based upon success in pre-clinical studies, as well as with other immunomodulatory agents.  He is also a co-investigator on a clinical trial of intrapleural injection of a recombinant, replication-incompetent adenoviral viral vector expressing the HSV-TK gene with patients with malignant pleural effusions.  In addition, Dr. Sterman has also been involved in pioneering clinical research aimed at developing advanced bronchoscopic techniques to treat diseases such as severe asthma, emphysema and prolonged post-operative air leaks, as well as novel diagnostic and therapeutic approaches for peripheral lung cancers.  He is a prior president of the International Mesothelioma Interest Group and a former member of the scientific advisory board of the Mesothelioma Applied Research Foundation.

",angell03@nyu.edu,,,"I was inspired to pursue medicine by my father, who was a general practitioner. As a child, I was interested in his work and vast medical knowledge, and as a student, I fell in love with learning about the anatomy and physiology of the body and the technological advances that can improve people’s lives.
I specialize in pulmonary medicine and critical care, primarily treating people who have advanced lung diseases that affect their quality of life. Many of my patients benefit from lung transplants, and I have dedicated the last two decades of my career to lung transplantation and caring for patients who are waiting for or who have already received a lung transplant. Additionally, I perform advanced pulmonary procedures, such as bronchoscopy, to diagnose lung conditions and manage airway diseases.
Our team at the NYU Langone Transplant Institute is highly experienced and skilled. We provide individualized care and support for people and their families. Our focus is on our patients—everything we do is with the goal of making our patients the center of our practices. We also research ways to improve the care of potential organ donors and predict complications that may arise after lung transplants, so that we can preemptively treat them.
We use the latest technologies to care for and communicate with our patients. For instance, after lung transplant surgery, frequent follow-up visits are necessary, which can be costly and time-consuming for patients who do not live in the New York City area. Often, we are able to closely monitor a patient’s progress remotely and through online doctor visits using the NYU Langone Health app.
I am a member of the American College of Chest Physicians, the American Thoracic Society, the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation, and the Society of Critical Care Medicine. I have also received a Presidential Clinical Excellence Award and have been recognized for my educational efforts in training medical residents and pulmonary medicine and critical care fellows.",,"Board Certifications

Research Summary
Airway disease in World Trade Center population. At NYU Langone’s Environmental Health Program, we conduct research on identification of lung injury in surviving community members affected by the destruction of the World Trade Center towers. We are the first center to report the environmental impact of the destruction of the World Trade Center towers on respiratory health of the surrounding community. Dr. Baba’s work focuses on the understanding of molecular, environmental and clinical implications of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) in this population. As part of the Division of Pulmonary, Critical Care, and Sleep Medicine at NYU Grossman School of Medicine and NYC Health + Hospitals/Bellevue, he also partners in various industry- and American Lung Association- sponsored trials in asthma and COPD.

Clinical study of obstructive sleep apnea in urban population. In collaboration with the sleep laboratory at Case Western Reserve University’s MetroHealth Medical Center, Dr. Baba conducts research on the role of sleep disordered breathing in cardiovascular disease. This includes a prospective, cross-sectional study, Impact of Obstructive Sleep Apnea on Clinical Outcomes in Acute Coronary Syndrome (ISAACS), aimed at identifying the role of obstructive sleep apnea in patients presenting with acute coronary syndrome. As the lead sleep medicine physician for the World Trade Center Environmental Health Center, his interests also include the design and conduct of sleep medicine research in the New York City community population.","Board Certifications

adult fibrosing lung diseases, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, IPF

        
Research Summary
Two areas of interest evolved from my research and clinical activities. On the cell biology level, I am interested in how cell surface receptors communicate with their environment in physiologic and pathophysiologic states. The functional consequences of altered signaling are of particular interest for me as a physician since they give me further insight into disease mechanisms, such as aberrant integrin or growth factor receptor signaling in pulmonary fibrosis. On the clinical level, I have become particularly interested in IPF (idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis), a fatal, progressive lung disease with unpredictable clinical course, a median survival of <4 years and no effective treatment. Despite extensive research its underlying mechanisms remain unclear. One potential way I have studied involves EMT. In EMT, epithelial cell injury induces phenotype change to a mesenchymal type, resulting in interstitial matrix accumulation in alveolar walls and progressive pulmonary fibrosis with loss of function. Another potential mechanism I am currently studying involves embryonic signaling pathways, such as Hedgehog (HH) signaling, which are usually suppressed in adult uninjured lung, but might become reactivated as pathogenic mechanism in IPF.

In our lab we have shown HH pathway reactivation in lung fibroblasts in two important settings: (1) during alveolar septum formation in the postnatal lung and (2) in bleomycin-injured fibrotic lung. In the early postnatal developmental setting, inhibition of HH signaling produced alveolar airspace enlargement and septum wall thinning without affecting septum formation. This indicates the importance of precise temporal decrease in mesenchyme for normal lung structure. In the pathophysiological setting, the exacerbation of bleomycin-induced fibrosis by SHH over-expression implies that aberrant pathway activity prevents the demise of lung fibroblasts during fibrosis resolution.

The long-term goals of my work are to better understand the molecular signatures of pulmonary fibrosis by studying their characteristics in pathophysiologically relevant mouse models to elucidate novel mechanisms and improve treatment options.","Board Certifications

Medicine seemed like a natural career choice. I chose to specialize in pulmonary and critical care because it is a complex and challenging specialty that allows me to work closely with patients.
At the NYU Langone Transplant Institute, I care for people who have lung conditions, including interstitial lung disease, advanced chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), advanced bronchiectasis, or pulmonary fibrosis, before and after lung transplantation. After patients have a lung transplant, I meet with them regularly to provide lifelong care. My patients and I develop a close relationship, and I find that very rewarding. Our team at NYU Langone is highly skilled, and we’re focused on helping our patients return to their families and daily activities as soon as possible. Our goal is for them to enjoy an optimal quality of life.
Many of our patients come from out of state to receive a lung transplant, and the frequent visits required after surgery can be a burden in terms of expense and time. Fortunately, we have the capability to remotely monitor our patients’ recovery and health and conduct follow-up appointments through online doctor visits using the NYU Langone Health app.

how integrins activate latent TGF?1 and TGF?3 during development and in disease, cancer

        
Research Summary
Our lab studies how latent forms of TGF? are activated by integrins in vivo.

TGF? is a ubiquitously produced growth factor with important roles in pathologic processes such as cancer, fibrosis and autoimmunity, and in normal development, wound repair and homeostasis. There are three TGF? isoforms, and all are secreted in a latent form. Latency is the result of a noncovalent association of the growth factor with its propeptide, which is called latency-associate peptide (LAP). TGF? must be released from LAP before it can bind TGF? receptors. The activation step is highly regulated but the specific activation mechanisms involved vivo have been poorly understood.

We discovered that ?v?6, a cell surface adhesion molecule in the integrin family, can activate latent TGF?1 and TGF?3 by interacting with an RGD sequence in the TGF?1 and TGF?3 LAPs. ?v?6 is expressed in epithelia, particularly after injury. Mice lacking ?v?6 have lung inflammation and are protected from lung fibrosis due to a relative lack of TGF? signaling in the lung.

We also collaborated with S. Nishimura's lab at UCSF to show that a second RGD-binding integrin, ?v?8, activates TGF?1 and TGF?3. Mice lacking this integrin have abnormalities in vascular development. Comparison of knockouts of the two TGF?s and the two ? integrin subunits reveals several partially or completely overlapping abnormalities in palate closure, immune regulation, and vascular development, suggesting that ?v?6 and ?v?8 are key TGF?1/3 activators in vivo.

To determine the role of all RGD-binding integrins in the activation of latent TGF?1, we made mice with a knock-in mutation of the TGF?1 gene that changes the RGD site to RGE. These mice produce normal amounts of latent TGF?1, but it cannot be activated by RGD-binding integrins. Strikingly, the mice have the same abnormalities seen in TGF?1-null mice, indicating that RGD-binding integrins are indispensable for TGF?1 activation.

We are currently further exploring the connection between these two integrins and the two RGD-containing TGF? isoforms by generating mice with combined TGF?1/3 mutations and mice with combined ?v?6/?v?8 deficits. Our results support a tight functional system involving the two TGF?s and the two activating integrins. For example, mice with combined ?v?6/?v?8 deficits have completely penetrant cleft palate, and mice with combined TGF?1/3 mutations have the CNS vascular changes seen in ?v?8-null mice.

We are now focusing on the immune phenotype of mice lacking function of both ?v?6 and ?v?8. These mice develop severe autoimmune reactions that appear identical to (if not more severe than) those of TGF?1-null mice. Also, we are testing the effectiveness of an inhibitory anti-?v?6 mAb, developed by Biogen Idec, in mouse models of lung fibrosis. We find that anti-?v?6 treatment effectively prevents radiation-induced lung fibrosis in mice, raising the possibility that such treatment might benefit patients with various forms of lung fibrosis.

Research Summary
My research focuses on lung diseases, including environmental lung disease, tuberculosis (TB), TB/HIV, early detection of lung cancer, and policy related to air pollution and climate change.

A particular area of interest is the role of alveolar macrophages (AMs) in environmental lung disease. In the lower respiratory tract, AMs phagocytose inorganic particles and microorganisms, playing an important role in host defense. AMs also respond to and direct inflammatory and fibrotic processes via a complex array of intracellular machinery.

By releasing peptide growth factors, such as platelet-derived growth factor and insulin-like growth factor 1, AMs stimulate fibroblast proliferation, which contributes to fibrosis. Through the release of interleukin 8 (IL-8), macrophages attract neutrophils and lymphocytes by chemotaxis to participate in immune-effector functions. Macrophages also process antigen and present it to naive T lymphocytes, activating them in immune or cytotoxic responses. AMs are a major source of the cytokines interleukin-1 beta (IL-1?), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF?), and interleukin 6 (IL-6)—all of which participate in granulomatous lung inflammation. In addition, AMs can phagocytose apoptotic neutrophils and lymphocytes participating in programmed cell death.

At the William N. Rom Environmental Lung Disease Laboratory at NYC Health + Hospitals/Bellevue we research the health effects of exposure to World Trade Center dust, air pollution, and occupational particulate matter. We analyze bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cells, bronchial brush biopsies, and microdissected samples from lung resections to find tumor suppressor gene mutations and gene expression changes. The goal is to identify workers who are exposed to asbestos and cigarette smoke and therefore at high risk for lung cancer.

In our TB studies, we investigate the roles of interleukins TNF?, IL-1?, and IL-6 in the granulomatous response. In studying the transcriptional regulation of the genes encoding these cytokines, we identified nuclear factor interleukin 6 (NF-IL6) enhancer sites that respond to either Mycobacterium tuberculosis or cytokines stimulated by the mycobacterium. Interferon gamma (INF-?) activates AM to enhance M. tuberculosis killing, and IL-12 promotes the type 1 helper T (Th1) cell cytokine response. We use BAL to evaluate how these cytokines alter the immune response in vivo. We also study the interaction of NF-IL6 with the natural resistance–associated macrophage protein 1, or NRAMP1, gene in the AM to elucidate the genetic mechanisms of AM activation.

We have studied TB and HIV at NYC Health + Hospitals/Bellevue and at the University of Cape Town in South Africa. Using BAL, we have focused on the mechanisms of lung inflammation in TB. One major study in patients with TB in South Africa found that aerosolized INF-? dampened lung inflammation and hastened the immune response in TB killing.

We also have a research interest in the early detection of lung cancer and have been part of the National Cancer Institute’s Early Detection Research Network (EDRN) for the past 15 years. As a part of the EDRN, the NYU Lung Cancer Biomarker Center has enrolled over 1,500 smokers over the age of 50 with a smoking history of more than 20 pack-years in a CT-scan and biomarker research program. We performed biomarker studies in collaboration with other EDRN members and biotechnology companies. These projects also involved the work of Harvey Pass, MD, who provided lung cancer samples.

My most recent research is on “global heating”—a term that has supplanted “global warming” and “climate change” in describing the global health effects of a hot planet. As part of the NYU College of Global Public Health, I investigate the public health effects of air pollution, biomass cooking, heat waves, increased storms, and droughts. Based on current U.S. policies, mortality is expected to increase eightfold during the period 2050–2100. Wind, solar, and fourth-generation nuclear energy are possible pathways for averting this rise in death rates by reducing carbon dioxide emissions.","Board Certifications

My interest is to understand the mechanism by which inflammation occurs in Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) leading to lung parenchyma destruction and airway remodeling. In the Andre Cournand Pulmonary Physiology Laboratory we can study the distal airway function in patients with early COPD. My focus is on understanding the mechanisms that occur early in the development of this disease where therapeutic approaches might be more efficacious. Although the lung is classically though to be sterile, in COPD increased bacterial colonization leads to airway inflammation and accelerated airway obstruction. The reliance on culture data and contamination by oral flora has limited the ability to understand the effect of airway bacterial load on airway inflammation in early COPD. The study of the microbiome using ribosomal DNA sequence has now opened an opportunity to directly characterize resident microbial flora without the need for bacterial culture. As a pulmonologist, I have sampled the lower airway by bronchoscopy and have exploited recent development next generation rDNA sequence to define complex microbial communities of commensal lung bacteria that we have called a pneumotype. We have found significant bacterial DNA in subjects with early COPD and we evaluate how this pneumotype affects the innate and humoral immunity in the lung of patients with early COPD. By studying how the lung microbiome alters the lung immune response I hope to understand the physiological changes that occurs early in this disease and we may discover new therapeutic targets for patients with obstructive airways disease.","Board Certifications

",sulicr01@nyu.edu,,,"I’ve always been interested in taking care of others. I chose to become a doctor because I admire the compassionate and altruistic aspects of medicine; I wanted to help improve people’s lives.
At NYU Langone’s Pulmonary Hypertension Program, I specialize in treating people who have pulmonary hypertension—a condition that occurs when there is increased blood pressure in the arteries that carry blood from the heart to the lungs. Pulmonary hypertension is a chronic condition, so I am extremely involved in the long-term management of my patients’ treatment. I develop close, trusting relationships with patients, and I am accessible at all times in the event that someone needs immediate medical care.
In our program, every patient works with a team of healthcare professionals, including doctors, nurses, nurse practitioners, social workers, and dietitians, who collaborate in his or her treatment. We create individualized plans of care to suit the needs of each individual. We also treat people’s medical needs that may be associated with pulmonary hypertension by working with rheumatologists, gastroenterologists, hematologists, cardiologists, and surgeons.
I am a member of the Pulmonary Hypertension Association, the American Thoracic Society, the American College of Chest Physicians, and the Pulmonary Hypertension Clinicians and Researchers network. Additionally, I am active in clinical trials that focus on new treatments for people with pulmonary hypertension. My goal as a physician is to help my patients lead long, active, and healthy lives.",,"Board Certifications
