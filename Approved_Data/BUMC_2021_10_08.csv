Our research is illuminating the regulation and function of innate and adaptive immune cells and signals in the lung, and how variations in these parameters determine pneumonia susceptibility and outcome.  Lung defense consists of immune resistance (the ability to eliminate microbes) and tissue resilience (the ability to prevent or withstand injurious stimuli from infection and inflammation). Both activities are accomplished by the coordinated activities of diverse cell types within the lung, involving some that are constitutively present (including diverse types of epithelial cells, macrophages, lymphocytes, and more) as well as others newly recruited to the infected tissue (including neutrophils plus additional myeloid or lymphoid cells).  Effective and productive communication amongst these cells can efficiently destroy microbes without damaging the lung, maintaining respiratory health.  Dysregulation of these pathways instead promotes infection (e.g., pneumonia), injury (e.g., the acute respiratory distress syndrome), and other pulmonary diseases.  Elucidating factors that differentiate lung infection resistance and susceptibility will enable new approaches to preventing and treating pneumonia.","","Cell & Molecular Biology, ScD, Harvard School of Public Health, 1994

He directs Boston University’s efforts to facilitate translational research and advance team science, with a focus on the use of innovative methods for drug and device discovery and delivery and developing creative tools to expedite and retool traditional research processes.

His own laboratory is interested in two major themes which revolve around roles for Interleukin-16, co-discovered with Bill Cruikshank in 1982. The first theme relates to the functions of IL-16 as a immunomodulatory cytokine. Over the past several years, in collaboration with Bill Cruikshank, he has studied the role of IL-16 in recruitment and development of Regulatory T cells and demonstrated that it plays a key role in tolerance to airborne allergens. Utilizing transgenic knockout and overexpressing mice his laboratory is involved in demonstrating the patterns of CD4+ T cell trafficking through lymph nodes and lung parenchymal in normal and immunologically challenged lungs and identifying potential therapeutic implications of altering recruitment patterns of Regulatory T cells.

The second major emphasis of his laboratory relates to the functional properties of the precursor protein for IL-16, Pro-IL-16 as a tumor suppressor gene. In these studies, along with Yujun Zhang he has shown that Interleukin-16 is synthesized as a precursor which is present in cytoplasm and nucleus of resting T cells. It contains a phosphorylation regulated nuclear localization motif and binds a nuclear chaperone hsc70 which is essential for transport to the nucleus where its presence induces arrest of the cell cycle at G0/G1. It inhibits the cell cycle by acting as a scaffolding protein that assembles a histone deacetylase complex targeted via binding to GA-BP to the Skp2 promoter using intermolecular PDZ binding motifs. Skp2 is an essential member of the ubiquitin ligase protein degradation pathway responsive for degrading the cell cycle cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor p27. In the presence of pro-IL-16, the complex inhibits Skp2 transcription, which in turn decreases p27 degradation resulting in rises in p27 levels and arrest of the cell cycle in G1. Current studies are directed at identifying mutations in Pro-IL-16 that predispose to T cell malignancies and determining its role is permissive exit from G1 in normal T cell activation and proliferation following antigen stimulation.","","MD, Boston University School of Medicine, 1972

jsberman@bu.edu","","","I have had an interest in Pulmonary Immunology for over 20 years. I began by looking at basic mechanisms of lymphocyte accumulation in response to cytokine signals, and I have gradually turned my interest to clinical and translational research. In the past ten years I have divided my time between basic and translational investigations involving the novel cytokine, osteopontin, and clinical research involving patients with Sarcoidosis.

My interest in osteopontin (Opn) began upon hearing a report that OPN was the most prevalent message upregulated in macrophages upon exposure to mycobacterium. It is an odd duck amongst cytokines, in that it is prominently expressed in bone and is involved in disparate processes such as bone remodeling, wound healing, inflammation, and tumor metastasis. I have been interested in the immunologic and inflammatory aspects of Opn, and my laboratory has been involved in research linking Opn to T cell function, granuloma formation and interstitial pulmonary fibrosis.

My interest in Sarcoidosis rose out of my 20-year involvement in the Tuberculosis Clinic at the Boston City Hospital and an affiliated homeless shelter. Viewing Sarcoidosis as a “companion” disease to TB, I was intrigued by the mysteries behind this granulomatous disease. I gradually built a Sarcoid population within the TB clinic and 10 years ago spun off my current Sarcoid Clinic. My colleague, David Serlin, and I see approximately 150 new patients each year, some referred for second opinions and other referred for ongoing diagnosis or management. We have a number of clinical research projects ongoing, including the examination of the impact of atopy and nasal disease on Sarcoid clinical course, the use of nasal lavage and brushing for biopsy and prognostication in Sarcoidosis, diagnosis of cardiac disease, and management of calcium and bone metabolism in Sarcoidosis. We share clinic space and collaborate with Dr. Hap Farber and the Pulmonary Hypertension Center in the diagnosis and care of patients with Sarcoidosis who develop pulmonary arterial hypertension. We hope to soon be involved in a large national study of Sarcoidosis in African American women with Sarcoidosis.","","MD, Case Western Reserve University, 1978

General Pulmonary Medicine. Dr Fine is a Professor in the Department of Medicine and attends on the general pulmonary consult service, medical intensive care unit and acute pulmonary care clinics at the Boston VA Medical Center. In addition, Dr. Fine leads an active research laboratory. He is an-NIH funded Principal Investigator and Director of the Stem Cell Biology Program at the Boston University Pulmonary Center. He is also the recipient of a Congressionally Directed Medical Research Program Award (CDMRP) that is focused on developing novel cell based treatments for acute lung injury.

Background and detailed interests:

Knowledge about the identity, localization, and biology of lung stem/progenitor cells has lagged behind what is known for other organ systems. This state-of-affairs is a direct result of a variety of technical issues such as a deficiency of informative markers that can be used to precisely characterize putative stem cell populations in the lung. Advancements in the field have also been limited by impediments imposed by the unique biology of the lung, including its marked cellular complexity and slow cell turnover. One additional fundamental limitation in our knowledge base is an uncertainty over the true extent of adult lung regeneration.

The Fine laboratory is addressing these broad themes in a variety of experimental contexts, including mouse lung development and in models of adult lung injury repair. Using these systems, we seek to identify reparative and progenitor cell lung populations, and the genetic programs that control their fate. One particular interest involves understanding the origin, expansion mechanisms, and differentiation pathways controlling bronchial and pulmonary artery vascular smooth muscle cells during embryogenesis and disease. One example of this work is our focus on the role of Notch3 signaling in regulating vascular smooth differentiation in the peri-natal period. Our data indicate that this signaling system controls key aspects of a mature vascular smooth muscle cell phenotype, including a capacity to respond to vasoactive agonists in post-natal life. For these studies, we developed a series of unique mice that enable the high fidelity and independent isolation of bronchial or vascular smooth muscle cells for analysis. We have also generated a series of cell specific genetic mutants to support this line of investigation. An important extension of this work is to understand how the phenotype of smooth muscle cell populations becomes altered in disease. One salient example is elucidating the molecular basis for bronchial hyper-reactivity in neo-natal and adult asthma. Clarification of these issues has broad implications for understanding the basic biology of the lung and also for the design of therapies for asthma, pulmonary hypertension, and interstitial pulmonary fibrosis.

Our new focus on lung mesothelium is another example of our interest in deciphering the origin and differentiation pathways controlling the lung’s mesenchymal elements. Using a variety of novel genetic mouse models along with embryonic lung cultures, the contribution of mesothelial cells to normal lung development is being investigated. The objective of this work is to determine the specific types of differentiated lung cells that arise from the mesothelium along with the key signals involved in these cell fate decisions. These studies address important questions regarding the role of these cells not only in development, but also in homeostasis and disease.","","MD, University of Michigan, 1981

New challenges have emerged with the appearance of drug resistant forms of M.tb and the realization that the existing BCG vaccine is not sufficiently effective to eradicate the disease. Thus, the emergence and spread of drug resistant forms of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb) represents a significant global threat of re-emerging epidemics of TB with no effective therapies in sight.. Given the dearth of new drugs targeting the pathogen, interventions targeting host cells are urgently needed. However, our limited understanding of the virulence stragegy of M.tb remains a major obstacle to its complete eradication. In our view two major gaps exist on the host side: what makes some immunocompetent individuals more susceptible to M.tb than the majority of the population, and what makes the lungs an organ that is particularly vulnerable to M.tb. The lung is central to the virulence strategy of M.tb, because aerosol is the only epidemiologically significant route of M.tb transmission in human populations. Interventions that target the lung to enhance mechanisms of local immunity and prevent lung damage may produce the biggest epidemiological impact by preventing M.tb transmission.

We pursue identification of pathways exploited by the pathogen in the lungs of susceptible individuals – a critical node in the extremely successful evolutionary strategy of M.tb - and the development of targeted interventions. Our lab and collaborators described a novel mouse model of human-like pulmonary tuberculosis. The key element of this model is the development of well organized necrotic granulomas, which closely resemble the human disease, specifically in the lungs of otherwise immunocompetent mice. Using forward genetic analysis we identifed the sst1 locus as the one responsible for necrotization of the lung granulomas and identified the candidate gene Ipr1 using positional cloning. We have found that the Ipr1 protein is an interferon-inducible chromatin-associated protein involved in control of macrophage activation and death. Our current efforts are focused on understanding the Ipr1-mediated biochemical pathways and their role in host resistance to infections, control of lung inflammation and tissue damage. In addition we have developed a screening strategy to identify compounds that enhance the Ipr1 function, which can be developed into novel drugs that increase host resistance to M.tuberculosis and related infections.

During the course of these studies we documented the development of lung squamous cell carcinomas (SSC) at the chronic stages of tuberculosis infection. Because squamous cell carcinomas do not occur in our mouse strains spontaneously, we concluded that M.tb infection was sufficient for both initiation and progression of lung SCC. These findings experimentally proved a causal link between tuberculosis and lung cancers, recently confirmed by epidemiological analysis in humans. Thus the TB-infected lung presents a destabilizing environment for epithelial cells, yet factors influencing epithelial cell function in the context of chronic infection have not been much studied. We study lung epithelial cells over the course of TB infection to understand mechanisms of their injury, repair, and neoplastic transformation in order to develop interventions that restore epithelial cell homeostasis and prevent initiation of lung tumors during TB progression.","","MD, Samara State Medical University, 1984

Tuberculosis Research and Initiatives:

Our TB Clinical Research Group at Boston University School of Medicine’s Pulmonary Center is engaged in multi-center consortium studies, investigator-initiated local research studies, and educational efforts locally, regionally, nationally, and internationally. Our site has been active within the Centers for Disease Control’s Tuberculosis Trials Consortium (TBTC), the largest international consortium of its type, enrolling patients in both latent and active TB treatment trials and in pharmacokinetic studies. I serve on the Core Sciences Group, the major scientific oversight committee for this consortium, the Multi-Drug Resistant (MDR) Tuberculosis Working Group, and the Biomarker Working Group. Through work on the MDR-TB WG, I am honored to be Co-PI with a great research team on TBTC USPHS Study 30 which is Linezolid for Multi-drug resistance In Tuberculosis (LiMiT) Study, USPHS Study 30. This is a randomized, controlled trial of linezolid versus placebo with both arms receiving optimized background therapy for drug-resistant TB. Within this study we will conduct a biomarker sub-study to assess serum protein s’, clinical and other variables’ ability to predict response to TB therapy. Within the TBTC Biomarker Group, we are expanding the ability of TBTC to conduct biomarker studies in all TBTC trials, an effort which has already started with TBTC Studies 29 and 30. TBTC’s biomarker effort will also include measures of hepatotoxicity. I am chairing the TBTC Hepatotoxicity Working Group, which will standardize data collection and develop initiatives for biomarker collaborations in hepatotoxicity.

Other activities from our TB Clinical Research Group include helping found and participate in RESIST-TB, an international consortium formed to conduct trial of drug resistant TB. I serve on the Scientific Advisory Committee and the Treatment Shortening Committees of RESIST-TB.

Our group concluded a study comparing hepatotoxicity and treatment completion with isoniazid for 6 months versus rifampin and pyrazinamide for two months. This study demonstrated substantially more hepatotoxicity and no improvement in treatment completion with the two month rifampin and pyrazinamide regimen, which is now no longer recommended. An outgrowth of that work was a multi-disciplinary national effort to review epidemiology, pathogenesis, and risk factors for “Hepatotoxicity of Anti-Tuberculosis Treatment”. The resulting document was adopted by the American Thoracic Society as an official statement.

We have also completed a study identifying predictors of failure to complete treatment for latent tuberculosis infection at the first clinic visit, and we are working on patient acceptance of interferon-gamma release assay results versus traditional tuberculin skin tests.

Inhalation Technology:

As Associate Program Leader for the Inhalation Technology Program at Center for Integration of Medicine and Innovative Technology (CIMIT), I am working to develop new therapies for respiratory and other diseases. This new program brings together multi-disciplinary efforts to tackle major clinic needs involving the respiratory tract, either as a site of disease in need of treatment or as a route to systemic administration of therapy for disease elsewhere in the body. A novel project to launch soon will be inhaled xenon for neuroprotection.

TARGETS OF THE THYROID TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR 1 (TTF1, NKX2-1) A HOMEODOMAIN NECESSARY FOR NORMAL LUNG, THYROID AND BRAIN DEVELOPMENT AND OTHER LUNG REGULATORS IN LUNG DEVELOPMENT AND DISEASES.
One of the main goals of the research in our lab is to identify, characterize and understand the mechanisms of target gene regulation during lung development and lung diseases (Cao et al, J. Biol. Chem. 2010). We have used genome-wide approaches (Lee et al, Science. 2002 298 (5594), Harbison CT et al, Nature. 2004 431(7004), Workman C et al, Science 2006 312: 1054) to identify and map targets of the key lung epithelial transcription factor Nkx2.1 in the developing lung. This factor and some of their major targets are being altered in lung diseases such as cancer (Tagne et al, PLoS ONE, 2012, Varma et al, J. Biol. Chem. 2012). Potential links between development and cancer is now being evaluated as related genes may also uncover novel regulatory mechanisms for therapeutic targeting not only during development but also in other diseases associated with altered levels of Nkx2-1 such as neonatal respiratory distress, Brain-Lung-Thyroid syndrome, and acute respiratory distress syndrome.

ROLE OF NKX2.1-REGULATED MIRNAS IN MOUSE LUNG DEVELOPMENT AND DISEASES.
Many miRNAs are important in modulating lung gene expression and differentiation of progenitor cell populations. We are currently evaluating and characterizing potential Nkx2.1-regulated miRNAs identified in microRNA arrays by determining their patterns of expression and their effect in both cell proliferation and differentiation in lung development. We are also manipulating their expression in vitro and in vivo to validate their role in regulating lung genes and correlating their expression patterns and downstream targets in development and diseases because of the evidence that these genes may contribute to the abnormal lung phenotypes in Nkx2-1 mutant mouse models we are using and in cancer with the expectation that the ongoing analyses will reveal the underlying mechanisms driving cell proliferation, survival and differentiation in lung development and in lung diseases in which Nkx2-1 levels are altered. As the regulatory mechanisms to be studied in this project are also linked to tumor suppression our findings have the potential to contribute to the understanding and the control of lung tumor formation.

USE OF NOVEL NANO-EMULSION TECHNOLOGY FOR DRUG AND MIRNAS DELIVERIES.
Major challenges for development of a delivery system for miRNAs are the instability and their short biological half-life. To overcome this, one needs to optimize the formulation with smart drug delivery systems made up of complexes particles size of molecules in the sub-micron range referred to as nanoparticles suitable for the treatment of patients.

Using this technology, we have developed a novel Nano emulsion technology drug delivery platform that can deliver a medication contained within these compositions. Our composition is either a liposomal or non-liposomal, stable Nano emulsion selectively taken up by cells by exploiting the aspect that the Nano-delivery system is made of natural substances such as oil, surfactants and water, natural non viral gene vector such as chitosan a promising delivery tools for polymer-based nanoparticles or the highly efficient catalyst gold nanoparticles because of their potential applications in biology and medicine. We have successfully used this system to introduce Tamoxifen and Dacarbazine into human cancer cells (Tagne et al, Mol. Pharm. 2008 5(2): 280-6), (Tagne et al, Mol. Pharm. 2008 5(6): 1055-63)) and are currently expanding these technologies to facilitate introduction of genes and microRNAs into lung cells. 

Our lab is currently using this technology to deliver Hydroxyurea for Sickle cell disease (SCD) a complex disorder characterized by clinical heterogeneity and pathologic evidence of intimal hyperplasia, proliferative changes and internal elastic lamina disruption across vascular beds so do Pulmonary hypertension (PH), an independent risk factor for mortality in the suffering patients and other growth factors. We plan to utilize this technology with our endothelial cell cultures.  This represents the first attempt at direct gene manipulation of the endothelium using Nano-technology and promises to advance the therapeutic options for these patients.

Our design Nano emulsion based technology is capable of selectively targeting the cells/organ and delivering a combination of active miRs molecules with some tagged with fluorescent reporter or imaging agent(s) for live imaging.

katrina.traber@bmc.org","","","The long-term goal of the Traber Lab is to identify and develop new strategies to treat severe neutrophil-based sequelae of pneumonia such as ARDS and sepsis. To achieve this goal, we use in vivo and in vitro models of pneumonia to investigate mechanisms of neutrophil dysfunction in acute lung infections. Currently, we have been using two broad approaches to understand neutrophil biology. First, we are examining modulation of the neutrophil transcriptome during neutrophil migration from circulation to the alveolar space. Second, we are investigating how Oncostatin M (OSM), an IL-6 family cytokine produced by neutrophils in many acute and chronic inflammatory settings, including pneumonia, ARDS and sepsis potentiates neutrophil migration to the alveoli during pneumonia.

The goal of my research is to improve how patients, families, and doctors understand, discuss, and make decisions about medical care. Based on my clinical work, I understand why doctors are eager for new strategies to improve patient outcomes. However, we have a tendency to adopt strategies when there is still limited knowledge of the benefits or possible harms. It is essential that we understand these effects before exposing our patients to the harms that may result from management.

My research has focused on two core areas: 
1)	Identifying and de-implementing overly aggressive, potentially harmful strategies in pulmonary and critical care, 
2)	Defining and implementing patient-centered strategies to optimize the ratio of benefits to harms in lung cancer screening and evaluation of potentially malignant pulmonary nodules. 

I have received grant funding from the NIH, VA HSR&D, VA QUERI, Dept of Defense, PCORI, and several foundations to study these problems, and have co-chaired or participated in several clinical practice guidelines and policy statements to improve the quality, appropriateness, and patient-centeredness of care.","","Medicine-Internal, MD, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, 2000

My goal is to advance understanding of and treatment for genetic causes of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and the most common genetic cause of COPD, alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD). To accomplish this goal, I have established an integrated clinical and research program here at BU and BMC that includes the following components: 1) The Alpha-1 Center which I direct and co-founded with Dr. Darrell Kotton has become a nationally recognized center of excellence for the care of AATD patients and their families; 2) Patient stem cell repositories: I have overseen the creation of and direct two large stem cell repositories, housed at the CReM. First, we house the world’s largest AATD patient-specific induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) repository, comprised of iPSCs and reprogrammable blood samples from over 100 AATD patients linked to phenotypic data including imaging, pulmonary function, and liver biopsy results. Second, in collaboration with the Framingham Heart Study (FHS) and Vasan Ramachandran, the CReM now houses the FHS iPSC Repository that includes iPSCs and reprogrammable blood samples from >6500 highly phenotyped participants in the FHS; 3) Clinical-epidemological AATD Research: Under my direction as site PI, BU is one three sites in the country funded by the Alpha-1 Foundation to recruit 100 AATD subjects to undergo liver biopsy, detailed phenotyping, and 5 years of follow-up to define the prevalence of, risk factors for, and non-invasive biomarkers associated with AATD-associated liver disease; 4) Translational bench research:  my lab in the CReM is focused on the application of patient-derived iPSCs to study AATD and COPD.

The 4 core areas of my research are: I) to confirm the clinical significance of the iPSC platform to model in vivo patient biology and demonstrate its potential for testing potential therapeutic agents; II) to better understand the genetic factors and mechanistic drivers that predispose subsets of AATD patients to develop clinical disease; III) to elucidate the mechanistic contribution of putative COPD susceptibility genes to lung disease pathogenesis; and IV) to develop gene or cell-based therapies for AATD.
