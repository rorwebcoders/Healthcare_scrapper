Intrigued by the complexities of intensive care medicine and lung physiology, she accepted a fellowship position in pulmonary and critical care medicine at Harbor-UCLA, and, after graduation, continued her interest in medical education by joining the faculty at the University of Southern California, Keck School of Medicine.In 2007, Dr. Chang was made Director of Bronchoscopy at the LAC+USC Medical Center. Her top priority has been to transform this county hospital into one of the most cutting-edge centers of interventional pulmonology on the west coast. Under her leadership, it now offers advanced bronchoscopic diagnostic and therapeutic services such as endobronchial ultrasound, electromagnetic navigation, medical thoracoscopy, and bronchial thermoplasty, in addition to pre-existing capabilities of argon plasma coagulation, electrocautery, balloon dilation, and stent placement.Complementing her interest in pulmonary procedures, Dr. Chang also has a professional focus and interest in lung cancer.  She is an integral member of the USC Lung Cancer Program, and runs a weekly private practice clinic at the Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center which is devoted to not only the evaluation and management of lung nodules and masses, but also the treatment of pulmonary complications stemming from aggressive oncologic therapy.  As part of the multidisciplinary lung cancer team, Dr. Chang provides the interventional pulmonary support for minimally-invasive approaches to the diagnosis of thoracic lesions.Dr. Chang’s other interests include critical care ultrasonography, simulation training, and medical education. She serves as an Associate Program Director and a Research Mentor for the USC Pulmonary and Critical Care Fellowship, which is one of the largest training programs in the nation with a total of 21 fellows.
