His specific foci of interest include:

The role of micro RNA in sepsis-related endothelial dysfunction

The development of endothelial dysfunction and its resultant vascular permeability is a critical hallmark of the transition from uncomplicated sepsis to septic shock with multi-organ failure.  However, the mechanisms which govern endothelial homeostasis are incompletely understood.  As part of a multi-disciplinary collaboration, we have identified that human endothelial progenitor cells (EPC) mitigate vascular leak, organ failure, and mortality when injected intravenously into septic mice.  Simultaneously, 

EPCs alter the circulating miRNA profile through release of miRNA-containing exosomes which can be taken up by recipient endothelium.  Our current work is focused on: 1) exploring the mechanistic role of endothelial-relevant miRNA in sepsis-induced vascular leak; 2) characterizing the expression patterns of endothelial-relevant miRNA in human sepsis; and 3) exploring the therapeutic potential of miRNA in septic shock.

The role of patient characteristics and hospital structure and processes on sepsis outcomes

Despite no new pharmacologic therapies for the treatment of sepsis, mortality rates have steadily declined over the last two decades, likely due to implementation of improved ICU structure and processes and the systematic implementation of best practices.  As an early career investigator, part of my research focus has included large administrative database analyses in order to better understand which patient and hospital-level characteristics have the greatest impact on sepsis outcomes including mortality and post-survival hospital readmission. Specifically, I have been the lead investigator on multiple studies which have demonstrated that: 1) thirty-day readmissions after hospitalization with sepsis are as common as CMS-tracked conditions such as CHF and acute MI and are associated with patient socio-demographics, comorbidity burden and hospital characteristics; 2) patients who are hospitalized with sepsis at hospitals which care for high volumes of sepsis cases annually have better odds of surviving compared to patients cared for at low volume hospitals; and 3) residence in a medically underserved area is associated with higher odds of sepsis mortality.

Optimizing patient and family-centered ICU care through mixed methods research

As a multi-disciplinary research group including intensivists, behavioral scientists, statisticians, and health economists, we use mixed methodology to identify barriers and enablers to best practices in the ICU.  These data are then used to facilitate dissemination and implementation strategies to optimize care.
