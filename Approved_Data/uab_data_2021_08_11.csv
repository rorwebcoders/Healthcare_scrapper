Edwin Blalock, Ph.D., joined the Department of Medicine as a Professor in the Division of Pulmonary, Allergy, and Critical Care Medicine and became the Scientific Director of the Lung Health Center in 2009.  Dr. Blalock is a Distinguished Alumnus of the University of Florida where he received both a B.S. and Ph.D. degree.  He was previously a Professor in the UAB Department of Physiology and Biophysics, having been recruited to UAB in 1986 from the University of Texas Medical Branch, where he was a Professor of Microbiology.  Dr. Blalock is internationally recognized for his research in neuroimmunology, rational drug design, as well as the role of inflammation in chronic lung diseases.  He has published over 350 journal articles and book chapters and enjoyed uninterrupted funding for the past 38 years.  Dr. Blalock has served on two NIH study sections, as well as study sections for the American Heart Association and the National Multiple Sclerosis Society.","Unrelenting neutrophilic inflammation is a driving force in many human diseases.  Research in the Blalock laboratory has focused on understanding the cause(s) of and potential treatments for this aberrant process.  In what some consider a paradigm altering observation, the group has found that at inflammatory sites, neutrophil degradation of connective tissue proteins generates novel peptide fragments that can attract a new wave of neutrophils.  In certain individuals, it is believed that this neutrophil-mediated process becomes uncontrolled, leading to self-propagating inflammation and chronic disease.  In particular, a tripeptide (proline-glycine-proline, PGP) derived from collagen fragmentation, has been shown to attract and activate neutrophils via receptors previously thought to be only utilized by classical chemokines such as interleukin-8 (IL-8).Moreover, chronic administration of this peptide into the airways of experimental animals causes robust neutrophil influx and a disease similar to emphysema with alveolar enlargement and right ventricular hypertrophy.  Consequently, the research has focused on airway disorders characterized by a chronic neutrophilic inflammation such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), cystic fibrosis (CF) and lung transplantation organ rejection.  In COPD and CF, these researchers have apparently identified a unique proteolytic pathway leading to collagen breakdown and PGP generation.  This seems to involve matrix metalloproteases (MMPs) and a novel serine protease, prolyl endopeptidase (PE); these enzymes have been found to be elevated in these disorders.  Collectively, these findings have far-reaching translational potential for human pulmonary disorders, in particular, and chronic inflammatory diseases, in general.  This is rapidly being implemented in the diagnostic arena where PGP and certain isoforms appear to be biomarkers for COPD, CF, and chronic lung transplant rejection.  Future studies will examine whether PGP and its isoforms are prognostic for disease progression and efficacy of certain therapeutic regimens.  Rational drug design has led to the development of a variety of PGP antagonists and MMP/PE inhibitors that target this novel pathway of neutrophilic inflammation and, consequently, are prototypes for drugs to treat chronic inflammatory conditions.","Doctor of Philosophy in Medical Basic Sciences, University of Florida 1976",,,,

Dr. Cheng has spent more than two decades in biochemistry, molecular biology, and cell biology research and has discovered nine new human genes in the NADPH oxidase and heme-containing peroxidase families. He holds nine patents issued by the United States Patent and Trademark Office.","Dr. Cheng’s research interests also include exploration of the innate host defenses of VPO1 and MPO as well as development of hPx enzymes as antimicrobial agents, particularly for the drug-resistant microbes.In the past two decades, Dr. Cheng has identified and characterized five novel members of NADPH oxidases (Nox enzymes), two regulatory proteins of Nox enzymes, and two members of heme-containing peroxidase (hPx enzymes) family (e.g. Nox3, Nox4, Nox5, NOXO1, NOXA1, VPO1 and VPO2). Based on the functional association of the two enzyme families, Dr. Cheng’s research focuses on understanding the synergistic functions of these two enzyme families in maintaining the balance of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in cells, and in pathology, the outcome of ROS imbalance in cardiovascular and respiratory systems. These include the regulatory mechanism of expression and activation of Nox and hPx enzymes.Growing evidence indicates that H2O2 functions as a signaling molecule in cells. Recently, Dr. Cheng's group has identified that vascular peroxidase1 (VPO1) is an endogenously negative regulator of H2O2-mediated cellular signaling. Current working hypothesis is that VPO1 mediates diverse physiological and pathological processes via H2O2 on angiogenesis, extracellular matrix formation, cell proliferation, differentiation, and inflammatory responses.hPx enzymes catalyze peroxidase reactions and halide oxidation, and produce potent oxidants. VPO1 is highly expressed in the cardiovascular system and lung, and secreted into plasma and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, leading to the hypothesis that VPO1 plays an important role in the development of atherosclerosis and other inflammatory diseases such as asthma and fibrosis. In addition, the research interests include the involvement of VPO1 in the metabolism of nitric oxide, the formation of di-tyrosine cross-link and the chlorination of proteins.","Doctor of Philosophy in Molecular Biology, 1996

After completing her post-doctoral training in Immunology with Dr. David Chaplin, in Department of Microbiology, she joined the faculty of the Division of Pulmonary, Allergy, and Critical Care Medicine in the Department of Medicine in 2011 as an Assistant Professor.Dr. Deshane is committed to an academic career combining basic and translational research with an emphasis on inflammatory diseases of the airway. Research in Dr. Deshane’s laboratory is focused on myeloid-derived regulatory cells (MDRCs) and their immunoregulatory roles in chronic inflammatory lung diseases. Dr. Deshane is particularly interested in delineating mechanisms underlying the differentiation, activation, metabolism and function of MDRCs. Her group recently reported that a subset of reactive oxygen species (ROS)-producing MDRCs exacerbate T cell responses and airway hyper-reactivity in mice. They recently characterized human MDRC subsets in bronchoalveolar lavage of asthmatics.","Dr. Deshane’s current research interests are to study effects of MDRCs on post-translational oxidative and nitrative modifications of self-peptides. This study is based the hypothesis that these modified self-proteins are recognized as non-tolerized neo-antigens and stimulate Th responses that underlie the immunopathology of asthma. Furthermore, her lab investigates how environmental pollutants such as tobacco smoke would impact MDRC function and contribute to exacerbation of inflammation in asthmatic smokers. These studies will provide insight into the role of MDRC in tobacco related pathology of the lung.Dr. Deshane’s group also studies the function of these myeloid-lineage cells in anti-tumor immunity. They have developed novel therapeutic strategies to target these immunoregulatory cells to enhance anti-tumor immunity for lung cancer; in parallel, they seek to understand molecular signatures of the tumor microenvironment (TME). Their innovative therapeutic strategy targets Indoleamine 2, 3- dioxygenase (IDO), an enzyme that regulates tryptophan metabolism in the TME and suppresses the function of these regulatory myeloid cells. This novel strategy has distinct advantages over existing immunotherapy strategies targeting CTLA-4 and PD-1/PDL-1 in that it overrides the IDO resistance associated with current immunotherapy strategies. Dr. Deshane’s group investigates the mechanisms by which this therapeutic strategy induces metabolic reprogramming in the TME involving IDO and the nutrient sensing metabolic signaling pathways. They also seek to translate these findings in human studies to investigate efficacy of combination chemotherapy strategies in targeting these cells and amino acid metabolism pathways in lung cancer patients.","University of Alabama at Birmingham, Other

Edwin Blalock's laboratory have worked together to describe the proteolytic pathways involved in the generation of a novel neutrophil chemoattractant, proline-glycine-proline (PGP).  Dr. Gaggar's group has shown that this chemoattractant is generated by the cleavage of collagen by matrix metalloprotease (MMP)-8 and MMP-9, in conjunction with a novel serine protease, prolyl endopeptidase (PE). Dr. Gaggar's group has also highlighted the relative contribution of PGP in development of BOS, demonstrating for the first time the impact this peptide might play in clinical lung disease.

Before moving to Birmingham, I worked as a Cystic Fibrosis Foundation Postdoctoral Fellow in Dr. Jennifer Bomberger’s lab at the University of Pittsburgh, where I began my work on host-pathogen interactions in the respiratory tract using airway epithelial cell co-culture models. Prior to this, I worked as a Postdoctoral Fellow with Dr. Jo Handelsman at Yale University studying factors required for bacterial persistence and competition in the gut. I earned my PhD in Microbiology from the University of Iowa in Dr. Alex Horswill's lab studying Staphylococcus aureus biofilms, and my thesis focused on how biofilm growth and development is regulated by the production of extracellular nucleases that modify the biofilm matrix. I am originally from Wisconsin and attended the University of Wisconsin-Madison as an undergraduate, where I majored in Medical Microbiology and Immunology and worked in the lab of Dr. Joseph Dillard, studying Neisseria gonorrhoeae pathogenicity islands. I am interested in the interactions that take place between bacteria and the host over the course of chronic respiratory infections, especially in polymicrobial environments, and how the complex interplay of signals from other bacterial community members and the host environment impacts behavior and evolution of bacterial pathogens in the airways.","My research program is focused on investigating innate immune-bacterial interactions in the respiratory tract. I am especially interested in pursuing studies of Gram-positive bacterial species, including pathogens and commensal organisms, and their role in microbial community development. I am broadly interested in how the epithelial innate immune response impacts individual microbes and populations of microbes in multi-species communities, influencing bacterial pathogenicity and persistence. In my studies, I use airway epithelial cell co-culture models to investigate host-microbe and microbe-microbe interactions occurring in polymicrobial respiratory infections. Next-generation sequencing approaches, including whole-genome sequencing of clinical isolates and dual host-pathogen RNA sequencing, allow my laboratory to investigate bacterial evolution during infection and to evaluate transcriptomic changes occurring in both the airway epithelium and bacterial pathogens during co-infections. I will use these techniques to evaluate how pathogens and commensal microbes sense and respond to changes in host immune status and will seek to further develop new model systems for investigating host-polymicrobial interactions. By examining the crosstalk occurring between microbes at the mucosal interface, I hope to make significant contributions towards our understanding of how changes in the host environment impact complex bacterial communities and affect disease progression.","University of Pittsburgh Microbiology and Molecular Genetics, Postdoctoral Fellowship

Nahm, Professor of Department of Medicine, with secondary appointment in Microbiology, obtained both his BA degree (in 1970) and MD degree (in 1974) from Washington University in St. Louis MO. In 1980, he completed both Internal Medicine and Laboratory Medicine residency training in Pathology Department, as well as completing post-doctoral research training in Microbiology Department at Washington University in St. Louis MO. He was a faculty member at Washington University in St. Louis and University of Rochester before he joined UAB. He was the director of the Clinical Immunology Laboratory for UAB hospitals.","Pneumococcus is a major human pathogen causing pneumonia and is responsible for a large number of deaths worldwide among young children and old adults. Its virulence is mostly due to its carbohydrate capsule, which encases the pneumococci and shields them from the host immune system. Antibodies to the capsule can kill pneumococci and protect us from infections. Because our body can make these antibodies if the capsule is injected into us, the capsule is useful as a vaccine against pneumococcal infections. Pneumococci can express almost 100 types of capsule, but actual vaccines contain 10-23 common capsule types (serotypes). Following the widespread use of these vaccines however, serotypes absent from the vaccine have become more common, and vaccines have become less effective overall. To understand how pneumococci can evade vaccines, and to improve these vaccines, my laboratory studies diversity and immunity to the pneumococcus capsule. Our studies of capsule diversity have led us to discover many new and important capsule types. Our discovery of serotype 6C showed how pneumococci can evade pneumococcal vaccines and has provided knowledge essential to vaccine design. Our discovery of 11E showed that innate immunity can recognize capsule and induce changes in capsule-making genes as pneumococci adapt to live in different body niches. It also showed that innate immunity can recognize variable pathogen structures and how pneumococci adapt to different niches of the body. We are now investigating how completely the capsule encases a bacterium. If the capsule leaves some areas of the pneumococcal surface exposed, then the molecules in the exposed areas can be useful as new vaccines. To do this, we are currently studying bacterial capsules and their synthesis with new super-resolution microscopy, which can visualize down to molecular dimensions. Our studies of immunity to the capsule showed that some vaccines can elicit non-functional antibodies. Thus, vaccine development can be simplified if antibodies can be tested directly for their function. We have developed a practical way to measure antibody function by inventing MOPA (Multiplexed OpsonoPhagocytic Assay). MOPA has become essential in improving pneumococcal vaccines and has simplified vaccine manufacture and evaluation. MOPA is now facilitating production of low cost pneumococcal vaccines available for the entire world. Our laboratory has been serving as a reference laboratory to the World Health Organization in this field.","Doctor of Medicine, Washington University/St. Louis 1974",,,,

He received his BA degree from the University of Virginia in 1994, his medical degree from Vanderbilt University in 1998, and an MSPH from the University of Alabama at Birmingham in 2005.  He completed a combined Internal Medicine and Pediatrics internship and residency at the University of Alabama at Birmingham.  He also completed a combined Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine and Pediatric Pulmonary fellowship at the University of Alabama at Birmingham.  In 2014, Dr. Rowe was promoted to Professor with tenure in the Departments of Medicine (Pulmonary, Allergy, and Critical Care Medicine), Pediatrics (Pediatric Pulmonology), and Cell Developmental and Integrative Biology. He is the Director of the Gregory Fleming Cystic Fibrosis Research Center, which involves over 100 faculty members and has been continuously funded for over 25 years. Dr. Rowe is board certified in Internal Medicine, Pediatrics, Pulmonary Medicine and Critical Care Medicine and serves as a Special Consultant for Translational Science for the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation.Dr. Rowe has a remarkable ability to identify, establish, and cultivate effective collaborations across institutional and geographic boundaries. He established a prolific six-year collaboration with Dr. Guillermo Tearney to advance µOCT imaging for use in respiratory epithelia to ask seminal questions in airway biology. Dr. Rowe initiated an eight-year collaboration with Dr. Mark Dransfield to investigate acquired CFTR dysfunction in COPD. He has a seven-year collaboration with Dr. David Bedwell to advance translational readthrough approaches for genetic disease. Dr. Rowe is also highly effective in research consortia. He leads the International Mucus Clearance Consortium, involving Fundamental and translational scientists. He is also a key member of the cystic fibrosis research community, helping lead the Cystic Fibrosis Therapeutics Development Network through the Center for CFTR Detection.","Dr. Rowe specializes in developing new treatments for cystic fibrosis, the most common autosomal recessive genetic disease, and the cause of severe pulmonary disease affecting children and young adults. He founded the CF Transition Clinic for adolescents and young adults with the disease. He maintains expertise in the design and conduct of clinical trials targeting the basic CF defect. Dr. Rowe also has an interest in biomarkers of CF and other related airway diseases including measures of ion transport and the relation between mucus stasis and inflammation. He currently directs a clinical research program that examines the relationship between CF and the chronic bronchitis of COPD. Dr. Rowe is an accomplished academic physician scientist- a pioneer in the field of personalized therapeutics for CF, cutting-edge discovery in airway disease biology, and translational research. He is a respected authority in the design and conduct of clinical trials targeting the basic CF defect and has made key advances in the measurement and interpretation of CFTR function in humans and animals. In a related effort, Dr. Rowe has advanced both the molecular and clinical understanding of suppression of premature termination codons, representing an exciting strategy for treatment of genetic diseases caused by nonsense mutations, which are responsible for approximately 10 percent of all genetic diseases. Dr. Rowe has recently discovered that COPD patients exhibit acquired CFTR dysfunction through a pathway that causes delayed mucociliary clearance and confers chronic bronchitis. The approach establishes how a single gene in a rare disorder can contribute to the third leading cause of death and has lead to new efforts to evaluate CFTR modulators in patients with chronic bronchitis, potentially leading to a new paradigm for COPD treatment. Dr. Rowe co-invented one-micron resolution optical coherence tomography that captures 3D imaging in real time at the cellular level. The technique is highly sensitive to the epithelial function of airway tissues and can provide simultaneous and non-invasive measurements of the functional microanatomy of the airway surface, significantly advancing our understanding of airway disease pathogenesis.","UAB Hospital, Internship

He completed his postdoctoral studies in the area of TGF-beta, matrix biology, and lung fibrosis at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, where he later became a Department of Pathology faculty member. In 2009, Dr. Zhou was recruited to the Department of Medicine, Division of Pulmonary, Allergy, and Critical Care Medicine, where he is now an Associate Professor of Medicine. Dr. Zhou has received many prestigious awards, including the International Colloquium on Lung and Airway Fibrosis (ICLAF) Young Investigator Award, the American Thoracic Society (ATS) Recognition Award for Outstanding Early Career Investigator, and the UAB School of Medicine Dean's Excellence Award in Mentoring.Dr. Zhou currently serves as a PLOS ONE editorial board member, a grant reviewer for the American Heart Association (AHA), and a grant reviewer for the Department of Defense (DoD). He has served on ATS International Conferences as chair, co-chair, and facilitator and has also served on the program committee of the ATS Assembly on Respiratory Structure and Function (RSF).","Dr. Zhou's lab also works to determine cellular responses to intraocular pressure-generated mechanical strain that drive ECM remodeling in lamina cribosa cells and scleral fibroblasts harvested from clinical-records-confirmed normal and glaucomatous human donor eyes. Progressive remodeling of load-bearing connective tissues, like lamina cribosa and sclera, at the optic nerve head, is a defining feature of glaucoma. This remodeling alters the microenvironment of the retinal ganglion cell (RGC) axons traversing the ONH and is believed to be a direct cause of the axon loss and death of RGCs. Intraocular pressure is currently the only known modifiable risk factor for glaucoma. Dr. Zhou's Lab is currently funded by the NIH/NHLBI, AHA, ATS, and the EyeSight Foundation of Alabama (ESFA).","Doctor of Medicine, 2002
