Pulmonary disease",,,,"Dr. Jeremy Beitler is a pulmonary intensivist and Director of Clinical Research for the Center for Acute Respiratory Failure at Columbia University. Clinically, he cares for patients admitted to the medical intensive care units (MICUs) at New York-Presbyterian Hospital / Columbia University Medical Center. His NIH-funded research program focuses on optimizing mechanical ventilatory support for patients with acute respiratory failure, including acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).ARDS occurs in up to one-quarter of all critically ill adults receiving mechanical ventilation. Despite considerable advances in understanding of disease pathogenesis, ARDS remains associated with high risk of death—up to 45% mortality for severe disease. The most effective proven therapy for ARDS is to limit the degree of lung stretch with each machine-supported breath. Yet, how best to personalize ventilatory support to each individual patient’s unique risk of lung injury is unclear. Dr. Beitler’s research seeks to address this gap by advancing understanding of the interaction between pulmonary biomechanics and lung biology. He uses esophageal manometry to quantify lung stress in real-time at bedside, paired with serial measures of lung injury biomarkers to identify the patient-specific dose-response between lung stretch and biological injury.Dr. Beitler would like to express his gratitude to the many patients and families who have advanced this research by participating in clinical studies. He sincerely believes your essential support ultimately will help improve survival and decrease morbidity for patients suffering from acute respiratory failure.","Acute respiratory failure

For nearly two decades his laboratory has been making relevant contributions to the field, providing insights into how regulators, such as retinoic acid, Fgf, Hippo-Yap and Notch influence lung progenitor cell fate, morphogenesis and epithelial differentiation. These studies identified developmental signals crucial for progenitor cell expansion and differentiation of lung epithelial cell types, the molecular mechanisms associated with lung agenesis in vitamin A deficiency, the Notch-mediated mechanisms that balance the distinct cell types in developing and adult airways shown to be abnormal in chronic respiratory diseases, and the impact of prenatal fetal exposures to low Vitamin A levels in the susceptibility of the adult lung to asthma-like hyperresponsiveness.  Current interests include enhanced understanding of the ontogeny and molecular events that lead to lineage commitment of basal cells to an airway–specific program, the identification of novel components of the endogenous airway progenitor/stem cell pool in mice and humans and their role in pulmonary diseases. Over the course of his career as a Principal Investigator, Dr. Cardoso has received multiple NIH R01 and Program Project grants. Recent awards include a R35-NHLBI Outstanding Investigator grant and the Columbia University Medical Center Irene & Arthur Fishberg Prize 2017, for his leadership and contributions to the field.

Her laboratory has used whole genome linkage analysis and next generation sequencing to discover rare mutations in several genes (TERT, TERC, SFTPA2, PARN, RTEL1, FLCN) in patients with interstitial lung disease. These discoveries have implicated the telomere and surfactant pathways in the pathogenesis of lung fibrosis. Although patients with mutations in the telomere-related genes can present with many different subtypes of lung fibrosis, a diagnosis Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF) is the most common. Her laboratory has shown that a large proportion of patients with lung fibrosis have white blood cell (leukocyte) telomere lengths that are shorter than age-matched controls. Leukocyte telomere length is a biomarker that predicts clinical outcomes for patients, including survival, rate of disease progression, rate of rejection following lung transplantation, and adverse events after exposure to immunosuppressive medications. Some patient with an inherited telomerase dysfunction acquire gain-of-function mutations in the TERT promoter that provide a selective growth advantage for somatic cells.",,"Medical School:

Current research is centered in South Africa and Uganda with training/education and capacity building work in Ethiopia.  Important collaborators include the Centre for AIDS Programme of Research in South Africa (CAPRISA), KwaZulu-Natal Research Institute on TB/HIV (K-RITH), the Jacobs' and Larsen labs at Albert Einstein College of Medicine, and the Uganda Virus Research Institute (UVRI).Drug-resistant tuberculosis is an important global public health concern because of increasing incidence, low cure rates, and high reported mortality. Nowhere has this increased incidence generated more concern than in South Africa where interactions between TB and generalized HIV/AIDS epidemics are causing explosive increases in TB incidence and TB case-fatality rates. The most drug-resistant form of tuberculosis, extensively drug resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB), is increasingly prevalent in South Africa.Acute respiratory infections continue to be responsible for approximately 3.9 million deaths worldwide, predominantly in children, without a substantial decrease in estimated mortality over the past 2 decades.  In addition, outbreaks of emergent viral respiratory infections with pandemic potential and periodic outbreaks of severe acute respiratory infection caused by vaccine-preventable pathogens continue to threaten global health security.","Epidemiology Our team has published describing widespread transmission of MDR-TB and XDR-TB among South African health care workers. Using spaciotemporal analysis we have shown that influenza outbreaks are associated with periurban slums and temporally associated with the rainy season in a large dataset of influenza cases in Uganda .
Clinical Our team has described clinical treatment outcomes for patients with XDR-TB and HIV co-infection. Ongoing work includes a cohort study of later generation fluoroquinolones, and clofazamine, a leprosy drug, for XDR-TB treatment. We are prospectively studying adherence to Bedaquiline and ART in drug-resistant TB/HIV treatment using a next generation electronic pillbox.
Translational Working with the Jacobs lab, we are involved in designing clinical studies on biomarkers to quantify response to TB treatment, predict early treatment outcome, and detect worsening of drug-resistance in real-time among XDR-TB patients on treatment. We comparing deep sequencing approaches to identify limits of detection for emergent drug-resistance in clinical isolates among patients on treatment for TB.  Working with the Lipkin lab we are designing studies to use oligonucleotide probe libraries to identify emerging and vaccine preventable pathogens in patients with severe acute febrile and/or respiratory illness in Uganda.","Undergraduate:
